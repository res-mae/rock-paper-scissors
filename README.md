# rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game developed as part of **The Odin Project's** Foundations Course.

## Project Overview

This project serves as an introduction to the basic **JavaScript** fundamentals by creating a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game. It focuses on teaching core programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, loops, and handling user input.

## Notes

* The game is played entirely through the **browser console**.
* Users are assumed to enter valid choices (rock, paper, or scissors).
* As the course progresses, future updates may include a graphical user interface (GUI) and additional features to improve interactivity and user experience.
